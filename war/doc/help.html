<h2>Setting Up ODK Voice</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download the ODK Voice source code and open it as an Eclipse Dynamic Web Project (use Eclipse EE)</li>
<li>Right click <b>Project Explorer -> ODK Voice -> Export -> WAR file</b></li>
<li>Install MySQL 5.0 with root password of 'odk-voice' (this is not secure, you can change the user/password in DbAdapter.java)</li>
<li>Install Apache Tomcat 6.0.x</li>
<li>Create an odkadmin 'role': Go to <b>%tomcat_base%/conf/tomcat-users.xml</b> and add: <br/>
&lt;role rolename="odkadmin"&gt; <br/>
&lt;role rolename="odkrecorder"&gt; <br/>
&lt;user username="odkadmin" password="XXX" roles="odkadmin,odkrecorder"&gt;
</li>
<li>View the admin page at <b>http://your_ip:8080/war_file_name</b>. You will need to use the username and password you said in the previous step to access any of the linked pages.</li>
<ul>
<li><b>Manage forms</b> lets you upload, view, and delete forms.</li>
<li><b>Manage prompts</b> lets you record, upload, and delete prompts. See <a href="#record">Recording Prompts</a> for more details.</li>
<li><b>Manage outbound calls</b> lets you schedule outbound and view outbound calls and adjust outbound calling settings. Se <a href="#outbound">Outbound Calls</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
<li>Set up a VoiceXML client and point it at <b>http://your_ip:8080/war_file_name/formVxml</b>. 
See <a href="#vxmlclient">Setting up a VoiceXML client</a> for more details</li>

<h2>Setting Up a VoiceXML Client</h2>

ODK Voice produces voice dialogues using VoiceXML. A 'VoiceXML client' is required to interpret the 
VoiceXML and produce audio dialogues. There are several options for VoiceXML clients:

<ul>
<li><b>Voxeo Prophecy:</b> a proprietary, standalone application that can be run on 
Windows or RedHat Linux. Provides up to two ports (simultaneous calls) per machine with the 
free license. Can be connected to a VoIP provider or GSM modem. <br/><i>Recommended</i></li>
<li><b>Voxeo Evolution:</b> a proprietary, hosted platform provided by Voxeo. 'Development' 
applications can be created for free as long as usage is relatively low, and you can create free 
phone numbers for calling within the US. Licenses for production applications and worldwide calling 
are expensive. <br/><i>Supported</i></li>
<li><b>i6net VXI*:</b> The official supported VoiceXML client for Asterisk. VXI* has the advantage 
of running on top of Asterisk, but licenses are not free above some number of ports.<br/>
<i>Not Supported</i></li>
<li><b>VoiceGlue:</b> An open source VoiceXML client for Asterisk. VoiceGlue is open source and 
probably a good place to start if you want to run an open stack, but it is not feature-complete 
so will probably require a good amount of work to be able to be integrated with ODK Voice.
<br/><i>Not Supported</i></li>
</ul>

For most applications, we recommend using the Voxeo Prophecy platform, although it is not open 
source and free licenses limit the number of simultaneous calls per server. 

<h3>Setting Up Prophecy for ODK Voice</h3>
<p>Download Prophecy 9 from the <a href="http://www.voxeo.com/prophecy/">Voxeo Prophecy download site</a>.
You ned to install it on Windows, RedHat Linux, or CentOS. It doesn't have to be one the same server 
as ODK Voice, but it's preferable.</p>

<p>You need to connect Prophecy to a POTS gateway in order to make calls - you can either use 
a VoIP (SIP) provider or a hardware GSM modem. We will describe connecting to a SIP provider. 
There are hundreds of choices of SIP providers available online. We have had success using 
<a href="http://www.mywebcalls.com">myWebCalls</a>. Sign up with a VoIP provider, and you will be 
given a username, password, and SIP registrar domain (usually just the site domain).</p>

You will need to make some changes to the Prophecy configuration file. Go to {Voxeo}/config/config.xml, 
and add the following lines (the lines below are for configuration with mywebcalls.com): 

<div class="box">
<pre>
&lt;!--+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
       CT layer category
  -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-&gt;

   &lt;category name="VoIPCT"&gt;

     &lt;item name="DialingIntlPrefix"&gt;00&lt;/item&gt;
     &lt;item name="DialingPrefix"&gt;00&lt;/item&gt;

     &lt;item name="VoipGateway1"&gt;86.53.0.135:5060&lt;/item&gt;
     &lt;item name="Bridged"&gt;0&lt;/item&gt;
     &lt;category name="Registrations"&gt;
       &lt;category name="CustomConfig"&gt;
         &lt;item name="Username"&gt;{username}&lt;/item&gt;
         &lt;item name="Password"&gt;{password}&lt;/item&gt;
         &lt;item name="Domain"&gt;sipagate.com&lt;/item&gt;
         &lt;item name="Registrar"&gt;86.53.0.135:5060&lt;/item&gt;
         &lt;item name="ExpirationTimeout"&gt;30&lt;/item&gt;
         &lt;item name="VOIPType"&gt;Custom&lt;/item&gt;
         &lt;item name="ResolveRegistrar"&gt;0&lt;/item&gt;
         &lt;item name="PayloadSize" type="int"&gt;240&lt;/item&gt;
       &lt;/category&gt;
     &lt;/category&gt;
   &lt;/category&gt;
   </pre>
</div>

<p>sipagate.com is the SIP domain used by mywebcalls.com (most SIP providers use the same domain 
for web and SIP, but mywebcalls.com is an exception).
86.53.0.135:5060 is the SIP IP/port for sipagate.com. If you set ResolveRegistrar to 1, you should 
be able to just use the domain (i.e. sipagate.com) for the Registrar and VoipGateway1 fields; 
however, this has not worked for me. Unfortunately, figuring out the IP/port for your VoIP provider is not 
always simple; you can contact them and ask, or set up your VoIP with a <a href="">softphone</a> and 
use <a href="http://docs.voxeo.com/prophecy/9.0/wireshark.htm">wireshark</a> to see where the SIP requests are going.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://docs.voxeo.com/prophecy/9.0/">the Voxeo SIP config instructions</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Then, go to {Voxeo}/home.html (the file), to enter the admin console.</p>

<p>Sign in (initial user/pass are admin/admin, you can change them), and click on the <b>Applications</b> tab.
Click <b>New</b> in the upper right corner of the Applications window (not shown). In the Edit Application 
window, fill in the fields as shown below. Replace <b>alerer-asterisk.mit.edu</b> with your server IP 
(or <b>localhost</b> if Voxeo is installed on the same computer as ODK Voice).
Click <b>New</b> in the Edit Application window, and create a 
route called "odk-voice" linked to your application.</p>

<h2>Recording Prompts</h2>

<p>Once you upload a form, ODK Voice will automatically determine the necessary prompts for recording 
and lets you record these prompts over the phone.</p>

<p>After you have set up ODK Voice with a VoiceXML client and POTS gateway, go to the 'Record Prompts' 
page on the ODK Voice website. Now, call ODK Voice from a phone, and when you connect, press 7 to enter 
the recording console (if you have uploaded multiple surveys, you'll have to select one survey over the phone 
before pressing 7). You will hear 'Press 1 to record this prompt or 3 to skip it'; at the same time, text should 
appear in the red box on the Record Prompts web page. Press 1 on your phone and speak the prompt in the red box into the 
phone. Press any key when you are done recording. You will hear the prompt you recorded and have the option to keep it 
or try again.</p>

<p>After you have recorded the prompts, hit refresh on your browser to see all the prompts you've recorded on the 
website. You can press 'Listen' to hear the prompt you've recorded, 'Delete' to delete that prompt (which will allow 
you to call in again and re-record it), or 'Upload' to upload a WAV file for that prompt. Uploaded WAV files 
must be <b>8kHz mono U-law</b> encoded or they will not work. A variety of programs available on the 
internet will allow you to convert between WAV formats.</p>

<a name="outbound"></a>
<h2>Outbound Calling</h2>

<p>To perform outbound calling, click on <b>Manage Outbound Calls</b> from the ODK Voice home page .</p> 

<p>You will first have to configure ODK Voice for outbound calling. On the bottom of the 
<b>Manage Outbound Calls</b> page, you will see a configuration box. </p>

<img src="outbound-config.png"/>

<p>Below each box there are already instructions 
for what you should put in each box for Voxeo hosted (Evolution) and local (Prophecy) platforms. 
'Outbound call request URL' is the URL that ODK Voice should poll to initiate a call. In the case of 
Prophecy, it is <b>{Prophecy server IP}:9998/SessionControl/VoiceXML.start</b>. Outbound call token is the 
'route' for your application configured on the Prophecy server. Outbound caller ID must be
<b>sip:yoursipid@sipdomain.com</b>.</p>

<p>Once outbound calling is configured, enter the numbers you want to call in the box provided, 
each on its own line. If you check the <b>Send now</b> box, the calls will be sent immediately 
(in order). Otherwise, you must enter a start and end time and a retry interval, as a decimal 
number of hours. For example, if it is 1PM and you enter 2.5, 4.5, and 1 (respectively), calls 
will be scheduled starting at 3:30PM and ending at 5:30PM, and if a call fails (i.e. user does 
not answer) it will be retried after 1 hour.</p>

<p>Below this form is a table that displays all the scheduled calls and their status. Before a 
call is sent, its status is PENDING. A call that is answered changes status to 
IN_PROGRESS, and once the call finishes, it can have a number of different statuses depending 
on the call outcome (COMPLETED, NOT_COMPLETED, NO_RESPONSE). For calls 
scheduled for later delivery, information about the delivery (number of attempts, etc.) is also 
provided.</p>

<h2>Creating XForms for ODK Voice</h2>

<p>ODK Voice is designed to work out-of-the-box with <a href="http://www.javarosa.org">Javarosa</a>-compliant 
XForms. However, not all XForms features are supported, and ODK Voice provides a number of voice-specific 
options that can be added to an XForm.</p>

<h3>Supported Question Types</h3>

ODK Voice supports the following question types:
<table><tr><th>Control Type</th></tr>
<tr><td>input type="int"</td></tr>
<tr><td>input type="date"</td></tr>
<tr><td>input type="string" (not recommended)</td></tr>
<tr><td>input readonly="true"</td></tr>
<tr><td>select1</td></tr>
<tr><td>select</td></tr>
<tr><td>upload mediatype="audio/*"</td></tr>

</table>

You can also use <a href="http://www.javarosa.org/wiki/xform">javarosa preloaders</a> to get session information.

<table><tr><th>jr:preload</th><th>jr:preloadParams</th><th>Data</th></tr>
<tr><td>property</td><td>phonenumber</td><td>The phone number for the call.</td></tr>
<tr><td>property</td><td>sessionid</td><td>The unique sessionid for the call.</td></tr>
<tr><td>complete</td><td></td><td>True iff the survey reached completion.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Custom Rendering Attributes</h3>

Custom voice rendering attributes can be added to either questions or forms. These custom attributes influence 
the rendering of the form by ODK Voice. Unfortunately, custom voice attributes are not implemented 
in a standard (or for that means, pretty) way, since JavaRosa has not created a standard way of 
adding custom attributes. Attributes are specified as a list of semicolon-separated key-value pairs 
"attr1=val1;attr2=val2;..." To add form level attributes, append '#' to the end of the title in the 
&lt;title&gt; element, followed by the attributes, e.g.

<div class="box">
<pre>&lt;title&gt;My First Survey#skipConfirmation=true&lt;/title&gt;</pre>
</div>

Question-level attributes go in the &lt;hint&gt; element of the question control, e.g.

<div class="box"><pre>
&lt;input ref="/survey/q1"&gt;
  &lt;hint&gt;skipQuestionCount=true&lt;/hint&gt;
&lt;/input&gt;
</pre></div>

See the sample forms for more details. 
</pre>

Below is a list of custom attributes.

<table>
<tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Scope</th><th>Function</th>
<tr><td>digits </td><td> Q </td><td> For numeric question, play back the response as digits (e.g. two five) instead of a number (e.g. twenty-five). </tr>
<tr><td>skipInstructions </td><td> Q </td><td> Skip generic question instructions (custom instructions should be included in the question prompt).  </tr>
<tr><td>skipQuestionCount </td><td> Q </td><td> Skip saying `Question 1 of 3' at the beginning of a question. </tr>
<tr><td>repeatQuestionOption </td><td> Q </td><td> Remind the user that they can press star to repeat the current question. </tr>
<tr><td>skipConfirmation </td><td> Q/F </td><td> Skip the confirmation step for a question. </tr>
<tr><td>customIntroPrompts </td><td> F </td><td> Replace the generic form intro prompts with custom prompts. </tr>
<tr><td>resumeDisabled </td><td> F </td><td> Disable the ability to call back and resume a form. </tr>
<tr><td>maxTime </td><td> Q </td><td> For audio question, set the maximum record time. </tr>
<tr><td>stringCorpus </td><td> Q </td><td> For string question, specify the corpus. </tr>
<tr><td>forceQuiet </td><td> F </td><td> Prompt the user to stop talking if they interrupt the instructions, and offer to call back if the connection remains noisy. Not well-supported.</tr>
</table>
